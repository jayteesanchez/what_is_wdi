### An example set of notes in markdown (summative):

### [SYLLABUS!!][syllabus]

### **Define "web application", and name some alternate types of programs.**

1. web application: a stand-alone program (application) that is written to communicate between multiple computers using the web
2. [other types of programming](http://jamesmccaffrey.wordpress.com/2006/04/24/the-7-types-of-software-development/) include:
- systems development,  
- "native" application development / mobile development
- embedded development
- test or automation development
- system administration (IT)
- devops (IT)

### Describe the parts of a web application and the path our class will take to learn how to build them.

1. front-end or client-side: the interface for users
1. back-end or server-side: where the data lives
1. network: the structure that combines clients and servers, ften the Internet!
1. web-server -- handles incoming requests from a network and routes them to application servers or middleware
1. application-middleware -- some other program that may support the handling of requests within a server
1. application-server -- a program that stores and retrieves information according to some rules or "business logic", often a "web application framework"
1. **library** -- a collection of prewritten code
1. framework -- a type of program that allows developers to ease the creation of applications by taking care of basic operations and common needs
1. database -- a piece of saftware specifically focused on storing data -- lives with the server)
1. browser -- a program that allows clients to fashion requests to servers and display their responses

Our class will learn how to build programs with Ruby, and then learn about servers and build one using a Ruby framework called Sinatra. Then we will learn about how to write interfaces for web browsers using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Finally we will connect the two together using sophisticated networking techniques and complex interactions. To make best use of these, we will learn a more complete framework known as Rails, and a powerful SQL database.

### Remember for class:

1. learn to recognize when to go to bed
2. set timers and take breaks (pomodoro, for example)
3. talk to instructors / producers when necessary
4. **ALWAYS ask questions or ask for something when I need it**
5. check for understanding using lesson objectives
1. ** the virtue of handwritten notes**

### Remember to keep a list of (and have access to):

1. example code (from class and links the instructors give)  
2. tutorials (look these up and ask instructors about it)
3. lesson objectives

### Talk to other students about creating/sharing (maybe use HipChat or DropBox???):

1. notes
2. cheatsheets
3. stories, diagrams and pictures

### Define abstraction, encapsulation, interfaces and modeling, and how these general ideas will apply to our journey.

- abstraction: managing complexity when solving a problem or approaching a complex situation
- encapsulation: breaking a problem into sub-problems, and then hiding each problems' solution behind an interface that we can access
- modeling: removing complexity from a problem, and re-imagining what the actual problem is
